# 203 Non-authoritative Information

The 203 status code is like a capybara acting as a sheriff in the Wild West 🐾🕶️. Picture this: our capybara lounging on a lush pasture but still keeping the town in check, letting you know that the information you're getting might be a bit reworked by the local cowboys 🐴🌵. Sheriff Capybara doesn’t always deliver messages straight from the source, but it has its style – always relaxed, with a smile under its mustache.


The sheriff-capybara rides up to you on its trusty steed, hands you a report on the town’s situation, though slightly interpreted in its own way. It's not quite the original, but it still contains essential information that will help you navigate this wild, digital landscape. That’s exactly how 203 works – a laid-back interpretation that the sheriff-capybara is happy to share, always with a little western twist. 🌞🐾🤠
