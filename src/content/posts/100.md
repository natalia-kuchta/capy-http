# 100 Capybara Continue

When you find yourself chilling by the riverbank, sipping yerba mate, and a capybara rolls up with a knowing look, it's like the universe is saying, "Dude, chill out. Take a moment. Life’s good." 

In the world of HTTP, 100 Continue is that gentle nudge telling you everything's alright. It’s the capybara of status codes—calm, collected, and cryptically reassuring. Just like our lovable rodent friends lazing in the sun, this status code invites you to pause and enjoy the ride of HTTP communication.

So, what does it mean? You send a big ol' request, and the server gives you the thumbs up, like, “Hey, I got your message. Go ahead and keep sending the rest.” It’s like saying, “The vibe is right; continue to the next step.” 

Remember, when you see 100 Continue, it’s not just a code. It’s the essence of taking it easy. So, take a sip of your drink, watch the capybaras frolic, and continue your journey through the wild world of web development.
