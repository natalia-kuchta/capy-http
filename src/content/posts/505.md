# 505 HTTP Version Not Supported 🐾

Oops! It seems like you’ve tried to connect to the great capybara highway, but we're stuck in an old version of the Internet. Just like a capybara lounging by the water, sometimes things take their own sweet time.

## What’s Happening?
The server you’re trying to reach doesn’t play nice with your HTTP version. It’s like asking a capybara to jump through hoops - it just won’t happen.

## Think of This as a Zen Moment
Take a deep breath, channel your inner capybara, and enjoy the calm. Maybe stretch a little, grab a snack, and consider updating your client. After all, capybaras are all about enjoying life one sip at a time.

## What Can You Do?
1. **Check Your HTTP Version** - Make sure you’re cruising the web with a version the server supports.
2. **Try Again Later** - Sometimes servers need a little me-time, just like our furry friends.
3. **Explore Other Capybara Delights** - There's a whole world out there filled with cute capybara pics! 

Remember, life’s too short not to hang out like a capybara. Stay cozy, and we’ll catch you on the flip side!
