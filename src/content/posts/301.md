# 301 Moved Permanently

Ever had that moment when you thought you were headed to the perfect sunbathing spot, only to find out it’s been taken over by some capybaras lounging around? Just like those cute little critters, some URLs can be a little... *migratory*. 

## What Does This Code Mean?

When you see a "301 Moved Permanently" status code, it’s like a capybara waving goodbye as it drifts away to greener pastures. This status code is the web’s way of saying, “Hey, this page has moved to a new home, and it’s not coming back!”

## A Capybara's Take on 301

Imagine a capybara chilling by a pond, sipping on some delicious water and basking in the sun. One day, it suddenly decides to explore the lush fields of a nearby farm. Just like that capybara, your web page can change its habitat (URL) permanently.

Here’s how a 301 redirect works:

- **Visitor Traffic:** A visitor aiming for that sun-soaked page (URL A) unknowingly gets redirected to the fresh new meadow (URL B) where the page now resides.
- **SEO Benefits:** Search engines, like friendly fellow critters, take notice and start to associate the new home (URL B) with the old one (URL A). This helps retain all the cheeky link juice!
  
## Why Embrace the Change?

Let’s face it: even capybaras need to move on sometimes! Adapting to a new web address is essential for a smooth visitor experience. Whether you’ve rebranded or simply relocated your virtual hideout, a 301 Moved Permanently code helps your audience follow you right where the grass is greener.

So, when it’s time for a change, be like a capybara and embrace your new adventure. Just remember to set up that 301 redirect and keep your visitors coming along for the ride!
