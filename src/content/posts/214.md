# 214 Transformation Applied 👑

The 214 Transformation Applied status code indicates that the server has completed transforming the resource it previously received. This usually refers to a situation where data or a document has been modified in some way before being delivered to the user. An example could be file format conversion or applying other processing to the input data.


### How It Works ✂️ 💇‍♀️
Imagine a capybara at the hairdresser—she arrives with slightly messy fur, and after the visit, she leaves relaxed and beautifully groomed. That's exactly how the 214 code works—data that reaches the server may be a bit "rough," but after processing, it is neatly tailored to the user's needs. The capybara after transformation looks like a million bucks, just like your data after the 214 status transformation!


### Applied
It's a subtle way for the server to say: "Your request has been processed, and here's the refined, ready version we've been working on."
