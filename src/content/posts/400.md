## 400 Bad Request

Looks like you've stumbled into a wild capybara conundrum. This isn’t just any old bad request; it’s a chaotic capybara gathering! 😅

Imagine a group of capybaras lounging by the sea. Some are trying to sip the freshest spring water while others, confused, are busy trying to steal snacks from unsuspecting visitors. And among them is one capybara, who, resigned to life, lies on a turtle, as if saying, "Is this the end of my adventures?" 🐢💔

This capybara, instead of enjoying the sunshine and adventures, looks completely disheartened. The turtle she's lying on slowly glides through the water, while she gazes up at the sky, wondering where all the exciting moments have gone. Sometimes it seems like she dreams of better times when she could run and play with other capybaras instead of lying on a turtle’s shell, as if life has lost its meaning. 🌊🐹

Did you forget to add an important parameter? Maybe you used the wrong endpoint in your quest for capybara cuteness? Either way, you’ve confused our furry friends!

So take a deep breath, count to ten capybaras, and remember: not all requests can make a splash in the capybara sea. Review your input and come back to join the capybara party!

And in the end, remember our resigned capybara lying on the turtle—perhaps a spark of hope for new adventures still flickers in her heart, waiting on the horizon. 🐢✨
