## 400 Bad Request

Oops! Looks like you’ve stumbled into a wild capybara conundrum. This isn’t just any old bad request, it’s a chaotic capybara gathering!

Imagine a group of capybaras lounging by the river, some trying to sip on the freshest spring water while others are busy trying to steal snacks from unsuspecting visitors. They are the original chill creatures, but today they seem to be having a bit of a communication breakdown. 

Did you forget to add an important parameter? Maybe you used the wrong endpoint on your quest for capybara cuteness? Either way, you’ve confused our furry friends! 

So, take a breath, count to ten capybaras, and remember: not all requests can make a splash in the capybara pond. Review your input and come back to join the capybara party!

Remember: when in doubt, just add more capybaras!
