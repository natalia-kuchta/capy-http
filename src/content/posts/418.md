# 418 I'm a Teapot

## Description
In a world of endless HTTP statuses, 418 stands out as a quirky and humorous response code. When a client makes a request to a teapot, rather than brewing tea, it cheekily states, "I'm a teapot." This whimsical response captures the essence of humor in technical standards. 

Imagine a capybara, the embodiment of chill, lounging by a teapot, basking in the glow of sunny days. The capybara, known for its sociable nature, is the perfect mascot for this status code, as it represents relaxation and a carefree spirit, just like the carefree rejection of tea brewing. 

## Usage
The 418 I'm a Teapot status code is defined in RFC 2324, an April Fools' joke specification that humorously declares that any teapot receiving a request for tea is not capable of fulfilling it. So next time you encounter a grumpy capybara when asking for tea, remember: it's just a teapot at heart.

## Fun Fact
Did you know that capybaras are often called the "gentle giants" of the rodent family? Just like our 418 status, they remind us not to take life too seriously and to enjoy the absurdity of our daily interactions.
