# 408 Request Timeout - Capybara Edition

Sometimes, even the chillest capybara has its limits. Just like in that famous clip – a duck gives the capybara a little nudge, and suddenly, without a care in the world, the capybara tips over and gracefully sinks into the water with a gentle plop. Similarly, your request might have floated around in the digital ether for too long, only to give up on ever getting a response.

## Capybara's reflections:
**"Was it even worth the wait?"** – Just like a capybara giving up after a nudge, your request might have stopped trying.
**"Time to drift away."** – Maybe it's a sign to take a little virtual nap? 💤
**"Where’s my answer?"** – Like a treat that never arrives, you might be left waiting. 🍉

Don’t sweat it! Slip on your virtual flip-flops, relax in the shade, and try again later. 🩴🌴 Like a capybara, sooner or later, everything floats back to the surface, and more capybara joy is always just around the corner! 🦫✨

And if you ever feel like that duck 🦆, giving the capybara a little push only for it to collapse into the water without a second thought… remember: not every poke gets an instant reaction. 😉
