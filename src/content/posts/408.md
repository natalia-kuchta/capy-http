# 408 Request Timeout - Capybara Edition

Sometimes, even the most laid-back capybara needs to kick back and take a break. Just like our furry friend here, your request may have lingered a little too long in the digital ether, waiting for a response that never came. 

Imagine a capybara lounging by a serene pond, embodying the chill vibes of life as it peacefully enjoys the moment. But wait! What's this? The request for snacks or a swim didn’t quite make it in time! It’s a gentle reminder that sometimes, in the world of web requests, patience has its limits.

## Captive Capybara's Musings
- **"Hurry up already!"** – Wait, were you even sending that request?
- **"Time for a break!"** – Nothing beats a leisurely pause.
- **"Where's my response?"** – Just like a capybara asking for treats, you might be waiting for a snack that never arrives.

In this wild jungle of networked connections, don’t take it too seriously; throw on those virtual flip-flops, relax in the shade, and come back later. There's always more capybara joy waiting for you!
