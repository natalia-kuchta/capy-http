# 504 Gateway Timeout 🦙

Oh no! It seems our capybara friends are taking a little longer than usual to get their act together. Just like a capybara lounging by the water, sometimes things take their sweet time. 

Imagine you’re at a cozy capybara café, sipping on your favorite beverage. You place your order, the capybara behind the counter nods at you, and then... nothing. The minutes tick by, and you begin to wonder if they’ve decided to take a leisurely stroll instead of preparing your snack. 

This is what’s happening with the code right now! The server, in its zen state, has paused to reflect on life, enjoy the sun, or perhaps sniff some grass. It’s not that it forgot you; it’s just busy contemplating the mysteries of the universe (or maybe just napping).

### What to Do?
- **Breathe**: Take a moment to appreciate the beauty of life and the tranquility of capybaras.
- **Refresh**: Give it another shot and see if our furry pals are back on track for a speedy service.
- **Wait**: Sometimes, all good things come to those who wait. Grab your capybara plushie and relax!

Remember: Nature moves at its own pace, just like our lovable capybaras. 🦙💤
