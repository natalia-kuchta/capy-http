# 403 Capybara Forbidden

## Oops! Capybaras say NO!

You’ve stumbled upon a secret capybara pool party 🎉, and they are not too happy about it! Imagine capybaras basking in the sun, sipping agua, and fully relaxing. Suddenly, one of them makes a swift jump into the pool, disappearing beneath the water – clearly sending the message: “Not today, friend!” This is how they enforce the “Capybara’s Choice” rule.


### Why the Ban?

- **Capybara Law**: “Only the fluffiest and chillest are allowed!”
- **Chill Zone Only**: The party must stay uninterrupted – no uninvited guests 🚫.
- **Decision of the Capybara Elders:**: For perfect harmony, the council has declared this pool off-limits to outsiders.

### What Can You Do?

Since you can’t join them in the pool, you could:
- Admire their style from a distance and soak in their peaceful vibe.
- Look for places where capybaras welcome new friends with open paws.
- Send a funny capybara meme to your friends and spread the joy of their fluffy existence.


Remember, capybaras have their rules. Respect them, and maybe next time, they’ll invite you for a splash and the best pool party of your life! 🦦🎉🌊
