# 429 Too Many Capybaras 🦫

Oops! You've hit a capybara traffic jam! Just like the gentle giant lounging in the sun, sometimes our servers need a
break to chill and recharge.

## Why the Wait?

Imagine a capybara asking its friends to stop hopping onto the hammock at the same time—eventually, it just becomes too
cozy for anyone to fit! When you send too many requests all at once, our server needs to take a moment to catch its
breath, just like our furry friend.

**What can you do?**

- Take a sip of your favorite drink.
- Watch some capybara videos—trust us, it helps!
- Try your request again after a little while. Patience is a virtue, just like enjoying a leisurely afternoon by the
  water.

In the meantime, take this timeout to reflect on the tranquility of the capybara's world. Remember, slow down and enjoy
the little things in life—like a capybara munching on some grass!

Stay cool and come back soon for more capybara goodness! 🌾
